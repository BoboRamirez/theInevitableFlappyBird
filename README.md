# theInevitableFlappyBird

## What is this?  
Just a crappy flappy bird. Press SPACE to fly, and try not to hit anything. LOL

## Why inevitable?  
This is my first 'stuff' made by Unity. I originally tried making a Tetris game, but it turns out that a proper Tetris is still too much to handle for a compeletly noob like me. That's how I find flappy bird basic, simple but inevitable, for me. Git gud, I guess?  

## And...
.gitignore from [Unity.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/266303e2715f206bf9c41cb138133bdcaa79fa92/Unity.gitignore)
